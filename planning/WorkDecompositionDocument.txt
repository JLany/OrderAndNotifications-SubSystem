___________________
Conventions:
	- All endpoints should be of the form: localhost/api/controllername/action/{id=?}
	  Controller name should be a plural of the model it represents.
	  For CRUD, no action is needed, since the action is specified with the HTTP method.
	  HTTP methods: { POST, GET, PUT, DELETE }, CRUD respectively.

	- Method naming will follow Java's convention, camelCase.

	- Private fields for a class will follow the _underscoreConvention.
	  # With an exception for the properties (those who have getters and setters)
	    and do not provide any internal functionality for the class.

	- Want to test out something different than the main workflow? Make yourself a local
	  branch and do not forget to keep it up to date with main branch. Otherwise branches
	  are discouraged.
